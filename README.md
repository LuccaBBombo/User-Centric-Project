## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  

This website was designed for a singer, in it, you can easily find his social media links, listen to some of his musics and watch his music videos. You can also check the dates and location of the next shows, check tickets availability, buy tickets for the shows and even arrange for the band to come to an event by filling and submitting the contact form.


### UX

In this project, the design was kept simple and intuitive, allowing everyone who will use the website, to easily locate what they are after and help them achieve what they want with maximum ease.

* As a user, I want to be able to hear some music samples.
* As a user, I would like to see some music videos.
* As a user,  I want to know how I can get in contact to arrange the band/singer to attend an event.

### Technologies Used

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com "JQuery Homepage")

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.    


* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap Homepage")  

The project uses Bootstrap to allow for maximum responsiveness on various screen sizes.   


* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com "Font Awesome Homepage")  

The project uses Font Awesome to be able to use icons for social media links.


* [Google Fonts ](https://fonts.google.com "Google Fonts Homepage")

The project uses Google Fonts to apply the fonts used on the website.                      



### Testing

To test the responsiveness of the website in various screen sizes, I used the developer tools inside the Google Chrome browser, verifying how the website reacted when shown in mobiles, tablets, and desktops. Always referring to the "Console" tab to make sure that the code didn't have any bugs.
To test the markup of the files, I frequently used the W3C Validation Service to verify them.

#### User Stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to check when and where the next shows are going to take place, so I can make plans to attend.
* As a user, I want to be able to hear some music samples.
* As a user, I would like to see some music videos.
* As a user,  I want to know how I can get in contact to arrange the band/singer to attend an event.

#### Shows page:

* Go to the "Shows & Tours" page, where you can verify the next shows dates and location, also you can verify the tickets availability for that show.

#### Media page:
* Go to the "Shows & Tours" page, there you can listen to some music sample and watch their respective music videos.

#### Contact form:
* Go to the "Contact Us" page
* Try to submit the form with an empty input and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

#### Bugs:
* During the testing, I encountered a problem with the music files. To solve the issue I had to make them shorter, that way, making the file size smaller so they could run properly. 
* During testing, there was a problem with the home link on the navegation bar. To solve it I had to redirect the page to the "index.html" file.

### Deployment

For the deployment, the hosting platform used was GitHub. With every change made, I would use the add command before commiting them to my local repository. After that I would use the push command to send them to my GitHub repository page.
