## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  

This website was designed for a singer, in it you can easily find his social media links, listen to some of his musics and watch his music videos. You can also check the next shows dates and location, check tickets availability, buy tickets for the shows and even arrange for the band to some to a event by filling and submitting the contact form.


### UX

In this project, the design was kept simple and intuitive, allowing everyone who will use the website, to easily locate what they are after and help them achieve what they want with maximum ease.

User Stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to check when and where the next shows are going to take place, so I can make plans to attend.
* As a user, I want to be able to hear some musics samples.
* As a user, I would like to see some music videos.
* As a user,  I want to know how I can get in contact to arrange the band / singer to attend an event.

### Testing

To test the responsiveness of the website in various screen sizes, I used the developer tools inside the Google Chrome browser, verifiyng how the website reacted when shown in mobiles, tablets and destops. Always refering to the "Console" tab to make sure that the code didn't have any bugs.
To test the markup of the files, I frequently used the W3C Validation Service to verify them.

For testing the Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.

In mobiles, the font sizes were changed to have a better visual apeal for the users.


### Deployment

For the deployment, the hosting platform used whas GithHub. With every change made, the files would be added and sent to the repository to ensure that the latest version of the code was saved.


In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
